Made a new record! Almost))
Ahahahaha
Don't hold down the jump button!
How difficult is it to fly?
You'll fall anyway
Time flies so fast
Keep jumping!
I worry about the Persian more than about myself)
Oh, I fell
Do not look down
relaxing on the stairs =D
Someone said it was just a game...
Opened new jetpacks in the menu
Almost overtook =D
Nooooo
Stuck on this level
I didn't waste a couple of yuan in vain)
Check out the new skin
The secret of success: don't stop!
New record
Almost
=D
Yep!!!
Ahaahhha you're about to fall
After the roller I'll buy a new skin
It's a pity you can't push(
I got distracted
Cool!
I'm leaking it through the game
Today is not my day
(((
Damn it was close
GG
Well, nothing, nothing
Well, how is that?
Eh, I'll have to jump later
100% I will be the first
Eh, Iâ€™ll buy a new jetpack anyway)
Take a running start and jump off a cliff
Still won't overtake
How much does an assistant cost?
Damn cool map
Wow are you serious?
Damn it
I'm near)))
Look behind me hahaha
Someday I will pass this map
Oh my god
I'll definitely carry it in this one
Damn everything is cool so far
In one place again
I fly like a bird! :)
Lost on the platform :(
Pressure on the cross!
How long can you stand? :/
This card is just a joke :(
Someone give me some coffee! :)
I think I forgot how to fly :(
Today I'm having less luck than usual :(
How do they do it so easily?!
I just want to see the finish already! :D
I feel like Super Man :)
My fingers are tired :|
How far is it to the finish? :/
I'd rather play chess :/
Please don't fall now! :(
Should I just crawl up the stairs? :/
I fly at my own peril and risk!
And again at the checkpoint... :(
All these obstacles are just a psychological test!
Maximum concentration! :)
It's funny how time flies when you're in a game :)
Let's have a tea stop! :)
I feel like my nerves are on edge :/
Fly like there's a war tomorrow :O
I should have taken a flight course!
Someone give me a hint! :/
Why did I think this would be easy? :(
Buy jetpacks, they are top!
My fingers are already stressed :(
The finish is a new beginning, right? :)
If only there were turbo flights here! :D
It's like dancing, only more dangerous :O
My victory will be epic! :D
All these flights are good training for aiming :)
I hope my jumping doesn't attract the neighbors! :|
Is anyone else losing their mind here? :O
Fly like you're being chased! :|
Looks like I forgot what land is :(
I'll fall soon... no, wait! :(
Every Flight is a step towards victory! :)
I wish my grandmother could see this! :)
Looks like I'm playing with fire! :O
Does anyone know where the end of this carousel is? :/
New record or new disappointed look? :|
Just fly, they said, it will be fun, they said... :)
This moment is the longest :(
As soon as this is over, I'll take a long vacation! :|
How many more checkpoints? :/
I stand still, hoping for the best. :)
What a cool skin I have!!
I'm flying on the latest jetpack, it's super fast!
Set a new record for yourself, update your jetpack!
